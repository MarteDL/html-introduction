    <h2>You can always count on me when...</h2>
    <p>
        ... you are in need of some moral support. This includes but is not limited to: me listening, giving general engouragement, letting you vent, complimenting you, offering a distraction, having a laugh, giving (not necessarily good) advice and so on and so on.

    <h2>A funny story</h2>
    <p>A couple of years ago I moved to England to work there as an au pair. It took me about 6 months and a very awkward moment in the fruit ile to discover that pomegranate was not pronounced as a french apple (pomme) followed by a throwing weapon (grenade). I found out I had been mispronouncing it in the middle of a supermarket when I said it wrong in front of the eldest child of the family I stayed with. She was so kind to loudly laugh in my face for 5 minutes. Safe to say I now always say [POM] + [I] + [GRAN] + [IT] instead.
    </p>
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>When I lived in England I mispronounced pomegranate for 6 months before a 14-year old laughed in my face and taught me how to say it correctly.</p>
